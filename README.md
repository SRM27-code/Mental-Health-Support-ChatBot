# Mental Health Support Chatbot

## Project Overview

The Mental Health Support Chatbot is designed to provide emotional and moral support through meaningful conversations. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques, the chatbot offers users a supportive, non-judgmental space to share their feelings and receive compassionate responses. The user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit.

## Project Statement and Outcomes

The objective of this project is to develop a chatbot that listens to people and provides emotional and moral support through meaningful replies. The chatbot will be accessible through a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit. By leveraging NLP and ML techniques, this chatbot offers users a supportive, non-judgmental space to share their feelings and receive compassionate responses.

Upon completion, the mental health support chatbot will enable users to engage in conversations where they can express their thoughts and emotions. The chatbot will be trained to recognize and respond to various emotional states, providing empathetic and helpful replies. This tool will be valuable for users seeking emotional support and a safe space to talk about their mental health.

## Week-wise Module Implementation

### Week 1-2: Data Collection, Pre-Processing, and Model Architecture
- Understanding the type of data to collect.
- Collating and collecting all possible input questions and responses.
- Cleaning the data to handle null and missing values.
- Exploring various ML Algorithms and finalizing the model architecture.

### Week 3-4: Implementation, Training, Evaluation, and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Implementing the model using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Training the model on the labeled dataset. Splitting the data into training and validation sets to monitor performance.
- Using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
- Tuning the hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.

### Week 5-6: Chatbot Development, UI Development & User Authentication
- Developing the core chatbot functionality using NLP techniques.
- Implementing a basic conversation flow to handle user inputs and generate responses.
- Designing and developing a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for easy interaction with the chatbot.
- Implementing methods and pages for user authentication like registration and login and user profile management.
- Ensuring the UI allows users to input text, receive replies, and view the conversation history.

### Week 7-8: Review, Bug Fixes & Documentation
- Conducting comprehensive testing of the entire system to ensure all components work together as expected.
- Identifying and resolving any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
- Performing user testing to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.
- Preparing detailed documentation covering system architecture, implementation details, user guides, and technical specifications. Ensuring the documentation is clear and comprehensive for future reference and maintenance.
